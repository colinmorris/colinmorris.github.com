With monkeypox in the news, some people are encountering the phrase "men who have sex with men" ("MSM" for short) for the first time. I've even seen some hot takes positing that it's a new invention being pushed by woke moralists.

![Screenshots of some tweets describing "men who have sex with men" as a new or unfamiliar phrase](/assets/msm/tweets.png)

First off, there's nothing sinister or euphemistic about this plain English phrase which means more or less what it says on the tin. Why not just say "gay" (or "gay or bisexual")? Because the Venn diagram of these sets has non-empty "lobes" -- there exist celibate gay men, and, most importantly, there exist men who have sex with men but who do not identify as gay or bisexual. The potential reasons for this are many, but consider for example a man who...
- Is attracted to men, but denies this attraction out of shame
- Acknowledges his attraction to men, but eschews the label "gay" because he does not identify with the cultural stereotypes of this category (the British physique photographer [John S. Barrington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._Barrington) is a good example of this)
- Engages in homosexual acts when confined to an all-male environment (such as a boarding school or prison), but would not do so otherwise (["situational sexual behavior"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_sexual_behavior))

When it comes to messaging about diseases like monkeypox or AIDS, a person's risk profile is more a function of their *behaviour* than their orientation or tribal identification.

Secondly, it is *definitely* not a new term or concept. Many of the replies to the above tweets correctly point out that "men who have sex with men" has been in use for a long time, though the commentariat is vague or inconsistent about exactly how long ("a few years at least", "decades old", "since at least the 90s", since "around 1994", "it dates to the 1980's"...).

This post is the result of a weekend spent on a mission to pinpoint an answer to this question.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men) claims that *men who have sex with men* has been in use "since 1990 or earlier", and that the initialism *MSM* was coined in 1994 by dentist [Michael Glick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Glick), in an article about periodontal issues afflicting HIV patients. These dates are cited to a 2005 article from the American Journal of Public Health, ["The Trouble With “MSM” and “WSW”: Erasure of the Sexual-Minority Person in Public Health Discourse"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1449332/). 

Another source, the 2011 paper ["But Do Not Identify As Gay: A Proleptic Genealogy of the MSM Category"](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1360.2011.01100.x) gives two 1988 quotations as the first published references to the concept ("to my knowledge"), an antedating which has since been repeated elsewhere (e.g. [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953620301660), and [here](https://www.cbrc.net/rose-any-other-name)). But neither paper devotes much attention to the matter of antedating, so it seems plausible that we can push these dates back with a little digging.

## When was "men who have sex with men" coined?

Google Books turns up many instances of the 6-gram "men who have sex with men" well before 1988. Here's an example from March 3, 1978, from Jim Fitzgerald, a columnist for the Detroit Free Press ([available through the Internet Archive library](https://archive.org/details/ifitfitzbestofji0000fitz/page/95/mode/1up)):

> Anita Bryant recently said if government protects the civil rights of men who have sex with men, and women who have sex with women, it should do the same for "people who have sex with dead people and St. Bernards."

But we're not interested in the first time these 6 words were put together with a meaning that's the sum of their parts. We want to know the origin of "men who have sex with men" as an *idiomatic* expression. i.e. as a term in medicine and social sciences, explicitly intended to be inclusive of men who (for any of a variety of reasons) practice same-sex intercourse without identifying as same-sex attracted. In the above excerpt, Fitzgerald is clearly not using the term in this way (in fact, the full Anita Bryant quote he references explicitly mentions homosexuality: "Making homosexuality a civil rights issue would mean you have to give minority-group status to prostitutes, to people who have sex with dead people or St. Bernards.")

Notably, the term appears in the 1986 English translation of the third volume of Foucault's landmark [*The History of Sexuality*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Sexuality) ("les hommes qui ont rapport avec des hommes", in the original French), but only once, so Foucault was probably not intending it as a term of art.

The earliest instance of the MSM framing I was able to find comes from a 1984-1985 longitudinal survey commissioned by the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. To be qualified for the survey, "a respondent had to report that he at least occasionally had sex with other men *or* to identify himself as gay or bisexual." Here's an excerpt from the script used by the interviewers, who reached out to a random sample of households over the phone:

> For the rest of this survey, we are interested in speaking with one group of people who are at highest risk for AIDS: men who have sex with other men, or who identify themselves as gay or bisexual. Would you include yourself in one of these groups?
> 
> (IF HESITANT, CONTINUE:) We are also interested in speaking with men who may only occasionally have sex with other men. If you fall into one of these categories, we would very much appreciate it if you could complete the survey. As I said in the beginning, in no way will your name ever be associated with this survey and your answers will help the AIDS Foundation in their prevention campaign.

Incidentally, the [whole report](https://calisphere.org/item/883f5e69-f4e4-4e0e-ad49-1e06a313f55a/) is a fascinating read, peppered with surprising and occasionally moving details. For example:

> The general impression of interviewers was that heterosexual men were remarkably sympathetic to the survey and its importance -- 85% of non-qualified male respondents were noticeably supportive, while the remaining 15% expressed the range from indifference to what is typically construed as a homophobic response.

Of the 19 men who conducted the first survey, all but one were gay or bisexual, and their "gaydar" seemingly proved very useful:

> We also devised a system to keep track of respondents who initially refused to indicate whether they were qualified or not but whom the interviewer sensed probably were qualified. As the survey period progressed, we approached these refusals again with successful results. We completed interviews with 25 of the 62 refusals contacted, or 40%.

In the 1984 survey, 81% of respondents described themselves as gay, 6% as bisexual, and 13% as "other" - which is to say, enlarging their criteria to "men who have sex with other men" had a practical benefit in this case.

The results of the report, including the "men who have sex with other men" framing, were also published elsewhere, such as [a 1985 issue of the CDC's *Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report*](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000620.htm).

The earliest occurrences of the simpler "men who have sex with men" formulation I could find date to 1987. Some examples follow.

*Evaluation of California's AIDS Community Education Program*, a government publication from 1987 ([Google Books preview](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Evaluation_of_California_s_AIDS_Communit/Q2iupm_22-UC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22men+who+have+sex+with+men%22&dq=%22men+who+have+sex+with+men%22&printsec=frontcover)):

> Men who have sex with men but are not gay-identified had the lowest levels of AIDS-related knowledge and were the least likely to modify the behaviors. These men, who typically relate to the exclusively sexual subculture, may keep their homosexual contacts hidden from other parts of their lives.

Another 1987 government report, this by the Department of Social & Health Services of Washington State ([preview](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Report/naYeAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22men+who+have+sex+with+men%22&dq=%22men+who+have+sex+with+men%22&printsec=frontcover))

> At risk populations are often difficult to reach even through targeted efforts. Not all men who have sex with men identify with gay culture nor frequent gay institutions. The stigma associated with homosexuality causes men who have sex with men to deny to themselves that they are gay or bisexual.

And here are a few examples from 1988 which give some explicit commentary on the term...

From [some 1988 US Senate hearings related to AIDS](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Coordinating_the_Government_s_Response_t/vvCJTFNDmT0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22men+who+have+sex+with+men%22&pg=PA381&printsec=frontcover):

> Our [The Latino Aids Project's] target groups are men who have sex with men, Latino(a) intravenous drug users, and Latino(a) youth who are at risk for HIV infection[...] The reason I have used the term "men who have sex with men" is because in our community we have men who participate in sexual activities with other men, however, they don't identify as being gay, homosexual or bisexual.

This excerpt from a 1988 research article, ["Integrating Safer-Sex Counseling into Social Work Practice"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/104438948806900602), by Michael Shernoff powerfully drives home the practical value of this framing:

> In attempting to assess whether a client is at risk for AIDS, clinical social workers must ascertain both what the client’s current sexual practices are as well as what they were in the past. Simply asking ”Are you gay?” is not sufficient. Health care professionals cannot assume that a client who is not openly gay has not engaged in sex with other men. For example, a married man with numerous symptoms of AIDS-related complex (ARC) who had never been transfused, who reported no history of shared needle use or other risk factors for exposure to HIV, and who stated he was not gay baffled his physician. However, when the man was questioned by a social worker as to whether he had ever had sex with other men, the client stated that he had a long history of sexual activity with men.
> 
> Thus many men who have sex with men do not label themselves as homosexual and certainly do not identify with the gay community. Questions regarding sexual practices must be asked in an accepting, nonjudgmental, and gentle way that does not incorporate the use of labels. For instance, the practitioner may ask: ”As an adult have you ever had any sexual contact with another man?” If the answer is ”Yes,” then asking ”When was the last time?” can provide useful and pertinent information about the client’s possible exposure to HIV.

### What about *MSM*?

The source cited by Wikipedia claims that the initialism "MSM" wasn't coined until 1994, but this too can be pushed back. There are several pre-1994 examples of "MSM" at least being used as an abbreviation in tables or plots ([example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1403325/?page=4)), and I was able to find one early document, [a 1989 Senate report](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/The_American_Health_Care_Crisis/lSMjFtDuXkwC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22men+who+have+sex+with%22+%22MSM%22&pg=PA39&printsec=frontcover), which uses it in running text:

> AIDS incidence is growing more quickly among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) than it is among men who have sex with men (MSM):
> - In 1988, for the first time, more *new* AIDS cases were reported among IVDUs than among MSM (43.4% vs. 43.2%).
> - From June to December of 1988 MSM fell from 57.9% to 51.4% of [...]

## Trends in usage

As I wrote in my [earlier post about the history of "pro-life" and "pro-choice"](https://colinmorris.github.io/blog/prolife-antedating), it's important not to lose the forest for the trees when searching for the earliest occurrences of a particular term. We should also consider when a term was popularized, and how its usage has changed over time. The Google Books Ngram Viewer [is helpful here](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=who+have+sex+with+men%2Cmen+who+have+sex+with%2Camong+MSM&year_start=1981&year_end=2019&case_insensitive=on&corpus=26&smoothing=0&direct_url=t4%3B%2Cwho%20have%20sex%20with%20men%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bwho%20have%20sex%20with%20men%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWho%20Have%20Sex%20with%20Men%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWho%20Have%20Sex%20With%20Men%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bwho%20have%20Sex%20with%20Men%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Cmen%20who%20have%20sex%20with%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bmen%20who%20have%20sex%20with%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BMen%20who%20have%20sex%20with%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BMen%20Who%20Have%20Sex%20with%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BMen%20Who%20Have%20Sex%20With%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BMen%20who%20have%20Sex%20with%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Camong%20MSM%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bamong%20MSM%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BAmong%20MSM%3B%2Cc0#):

This roughly indicates that "men who have sex with men" began to see use in the mid-to-late 80s, increasing sharply in frequency through the early 90s, and more gradually since then. Use of the initialism "MSM" in print has trailed this trend by about 10 years.

(Technical notes: the ngram viewer maxes out at 5-grams, which is why I used a "shingling" approach of plotting "men who have sex with" and "who have sex with men". The fact that their lines track each other so closely (I set smoothing to 0 for this plot) suggests they both mostly occur as part of the same "men who have sex with men" 6-gram. The occassional use of the phrase "men who have sex with *other* men" may explain why the "men who have sex with" shingle consistently floats slightly above the other.)

To get a rough sense of the absolute numbers involved, Google Scholar turns up 1,080 results for the phrase "men who have sex with men" in 2000, 4,920 in 2010, and 11,700 in 2020 (though these numbers may or may not be fuzzed).

## Yeah, but what about in the media?

At this point, a skeptic might concede that *MSM* has been widely used for a long time in technical publications by public health experts, but how come all of a sudden the terminology is being used in the mainstream media (the other MSM)?

Well, here's a chart showing the frequency of "men who have sex with men" in the New York Times, from its first occurrence in January 1993:

![Number of NYT articles containing "men who have sex with men" per year from 1993-2022](/assets/msm/nyt.png)

It's been there all along! Sure, 2022 is a record high, but that's pretty easily explained by the fact that a virus outbreak disproportionately affecting MSM is a major news story! (45 of the 48 results for this year also include the term "monkeypox".)
