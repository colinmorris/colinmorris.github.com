Here's the top comment on [a recent Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLX1sI5ALi8/) by Britney Spears:

If you're the sort of person who would follow Britney Spears on Instagram your response may be a nonplussed *And?*

But if you belong to an older, less online demographic, perhaps attempting to parse this sentence left you with a bit of a headache.

This is just one example of a novel use of *not* which has been on my radar for a while. Below I've cut together some clips of other examples, so you can get a sense of what it sounds like when spoken aloud, and the contexts in which it appears:

TODO

You can also read some written examples I've collected from social media [here](TODO).


## What does it mean?

"Not X" as an expression of a speaker's attitude toward X is not a new thing. For example:

> [Alice draws the curtains] "Not another rainy day..."

> [Billy hears a crashing sound and goes downstairs to investigate] "No! Not the Ming vase!"

These utterances express some combination of surprise and negative sentiment, with the degree largely marked by intonation.

A defining feature of the novel use of *not* is that it adds a layer of irony to this equation. It expresses something like *mock* horror. When Nene exclaims "Not a white refrigerator, honey!", it's not because the sight of the white fridge has her genuinely appalled. She's just playfully pointing out that it's a bit *d√©class√©*.

In general, this "Not X" communicates a judgement that X is amusing and surprising.

When X is *intended* to be humourous, this can carry an approving tone ("Haha, good one"), as in this banter between Bob the Drag Queen and Aja:

<video controls width="480">
    <source src="/assets/not/not_blac_chyna.mp4"
        type="video/mp4"
    >
</video>

On the other hand, it can also be used derisively ("X is risible and you ought to be embarrassed"). Cardi B used this technique at least three times in a recent feud with Candace Owens, as in this (now deleted) tweet:

> Not you being mad at me for WHAT YOU TWEETED AND is published on public blogs .I ain‚Äôt made it up honey Google it yourself üò©üò©üò©

(You can read the other two - spicier - deleted tweets [here](https://www.vulture.com/2021/03/cardi-b-tweets-candace-owens-wap-grammys.html).)

Most instances fall between these extremes, somewhere in the region of playful ribbing. Including our Instagram post:

> Not me looking at this like a hidden clue from National Treasure

Which can be read as a very mildly self-deprecating remark along the lines of "Haha, look at me carefully parsing this Britney Spears Instagram post for hidden messages. I'm such a dork!"

## How does it work?

In these "Not X" expressions, X generally belongs to one of two categories.

### Gerundative complements - *not X Y-ing Z*

A striking feature of this novel "Not X" is that X can be a gerundative clause, as in

> Not Ed calling out Taylor like this

These are easily found on social media, but are difficult to find spoken aloud. (The supercut above has two examples at the end from YouTubers [Mike's Mic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuwUl4_fcRio_valO7_lxjA) and [Larray](https://www.youtube.com/user/LarryVonVanity) who incorporate influences from [Stan Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Twitter) into their speech).

It seems impossible to construct an expression of genuine shock or dismay in this way - even in cases where the subject of horror can't be easily encapsulated in a noun phrase. For example, after looking at the receipt for a restaurant meal, it would be very strange for me to exclaim with genuine alarm:

> Not that bottle of wine costing $100!

### Metalinguistic uses

The other main use has X be a direct quote.

For example, on a Reddit forum dedicated to old-looking babies, someone posted a photo of their preternaturally cantankerous infant with the title:

> Everyone knows not to bother Sondra from Payroll during tax season.

Leading another user to comment:

> [Lmao! Not sondra from payroll üòÇ](https://www.reddit.com/r/oldbabies/comments/lshqlu/everyone_knows_not_to_bother_sondra_from_payroll/gorf64l/)

Sometimes the material is explicitly wrapped in quotation marks (especially to avoid an ungrammatical/garden-path reading when X is not a noun phrase):

> Nah y'all just want Rina to get attention so bad that you'll invent theoretical negative attention. No one clutched their pearls, but maybe people turned off the tv lol.
>> [LMAO not ‚Äúmaybe people turned off the tv‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/jiutk5/rina_sawayama_xs_the_tonight_show_starring_jimmy/ga8z4on/?context=10000)

<!--This can be read as something like "Ha, I can't believe they said X!". It can be used approvingly (to emphasize an intentionally humorous turn of phrase) or pejoratively ("what you said was risible and you should be embarrassed") or somewhere in a playful middle ground. -->

Again, this metalinguistic pattern is not used when expressing genuine horror, e.g.:

> Not "your car has been towed"!

(Aside: While the label 'metalinguistic negation' is commonly used for expressions like this, it may give a misleading impression. Just because X is a quote doesn't mean that "Not X" is commenting on the surface form of X (what [Geurts 1998](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bart-Geurts/publication/221966748_The_Mechanisms_of_Denial/links/0fcfd50c10e3e286ee000000/The-Mechanisms-of-Denial.pdf) calls a "form denial") rather than the content of X. For example, when Kandy proposes "a fun game to teach you how to listen" and Nene responds "Not teach, honey", it does not suggest she would have been any less scornful if Kandy had instead suggested "a fun game to *educate* you on listening".)

## Who uses it?

Anecdotally, most of my exposure to this construction has been hearing it from drag queens, and seeing it in online spaces that skew young and gay.

But to get some actual data on this, I decided Reddit would be a good source, since comments map to communities (subreddits), which, in many cases, have fairly predictable demographics.

I wrote a couple [quick scripts](TODO) to scrape all comments on Reddit beginning with a pattern like `not (me|you|them) (thinking|taking|using|acting|trying)`. In total, I found about 1,600 comments. A manual scan suggested precision was quite high.

Here are the subreddits with the greatest number of these comments:

{% include not/subreddit_counts.md %}

For the most part, this list is dominated by small-to-medium subreddits whose readership is especially gay, female, young, or some combination of the three.

Given the small absolute numbers involved, this is a somewhat noisy signal (though I did verify there weren't any extremely prolific users distorting the data - no single author has more than 5 comments in the dataset.)

## Is it on the rise?

Here's the distribution of "Not X" Reddit comments over time:

![png](/assets/not/reddit_counts_over_time.png)

Not dissimilar to the trajectory of $GME. Here's a zoomed in view from the beginning of 2020 until the end of March 2021 (with one bin per month):

![png](/assets/not/reddit_counts_2020_on.png)

Judging by the dip in the last month, maybe this is a linguistic trend that will burn out before becoming fully mainstream.

## Where does it come from?

A lot of recently popular slang that has more or less entered the mainstream (*shade, tea, beat, chile, go off*...) has followed a familiar pipeline to get there, starting in [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) (or more specific largely-Black linguistic communities, such as the [ballroom scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_culture)), passing into gay slang and certain online communities (especially Stan Twitter and its progenitors), and eventually becoming commonplace enough to see use (or [misuse](https://jezebel.com/shade-court-lupita-a-confused-people-magazine-and-gr-1680005931)) in People Magazine or the Washington Post. 

In many cases, reality TV shows like ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' and ''The Real Housewives of Atlanta'', with their endlessly quotable, reaction-gif-able casts of Black women and queer artists, have played a significant role in exposing this slang to a wider audience.

Despite the construction's popularity on Drag Race subreddits, it seems that the show itself has probably had a very marginal role in its popularization. I grepped the closed captions for just about every episode of Drag Race and was only able to find one occurrence in 2020, and a couple in 2021 one of which is included in the supercut at the top (Olivia Lux's "not JVN all of a sudden").

On the other hand, we find occurrences on The Real Housewives of Atlanta as early as 2013. And while the Reddit data isn't especially indicative of use in Black communities (e.g. we don't see subreddits like [/r/BlackPeopleTwitter](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/) or [/r/BlackLadies](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackLadies/) having lots of matching comments), Twitter tells a very different story.

### Antedating

The construction seems to be absent from Reddit before around [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/30chsa/pearl_on_defense_reuploaded/cpr5dk9/). However, searching Twitter for similar patterns actually turns up many earlier results, going back as far as 2008. (Failure to find earlier instances from the first couple years of Twitter's existence are explainable by the relatively tiny volume of tweets during this time. It therefore seems very plausible that this construction existed even before 2008.) Some examples:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@fabglance1 lmfaooooooo not the george washington LOL</p>&mdash; Baepri‚Ñì ü¶â‚ôèÔ∏è (@owldara112) <a href="https://twitter.com/owldara112/status/1362555044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 20, 2009</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

More examples [here](/appendices/ironic-not-early-twitter-examples).

As far as it's possible to determine based on profiles, virtually all of these early tweeters seem to be Black, lending strong support to the idea of an AAVE origin.

### Comparable constructions

"Not X" fits in nicely with other examples of what we might call 'non-literal denial' in English. Compare, for example:

> Oh no they didn't!

> I **know** you didn't just call me lazy.

> He did **not** just do that.

In each case, the proposition being denied (e.g. that you called me lazy) is known to be true by all participants in the conversation. 

Grice's [maxim of quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle#Maxim_of_quality) says that we ought aim to make our contributions to the conversation *true* ones. Flouting this rule creates an implicature about the speaker's attitude toward the proposition. Something like "I find X so shocking or unpleasant, that I will (performatively) persist in my belief in ¬¨X even in the face of clear evidence to the contrary".

A less forceful occurence of the same implicature can be found in rhetorical questions like:

> Did you really just say that?

Or in echo questions:

> A: I spilled lipstick in your Valentino bag.<br/>
> B: You spilled **lipstick** in my Valentino white bag?!

### Tips?

If you're aware of any uses of this construction pre-2008, I'd love it if you'd shoot me an e-mail (colin@cs.toronto.edu) so I can update this post. I'd also be very interested in any existing writing on this construction. I tried searching, but it's an exceptionally hard thing to google - the only item I found that directly addressed this was [this UrbanDictionary entry](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=not&defid=15134005) from 2020.
